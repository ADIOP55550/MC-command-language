# MC_command-language

## Welcome!
I've recently made a new Notepad++ (download program [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/))  language especially for typing Minecraft's commands.  
It's free to use, but I'll be happy if you link to this git when you share it.
If you find any bugs, you can describe them to me and I'll make my best to fix them. 

## Info

1. Enter *Syntax* menu

1. Click on *Import*
